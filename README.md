# Parking-App
un-amazing parking web app made with datasets from URA and gov.sg. I am trying my best.

was testing my own ability to make an app with react on the frontend and express on the backend. Had to kind of design my own "API" becuase I kept on getting CORS errors and I was using more than 1 API service.

I think that the dispalyed cards and the website would have looked nicer if I had been able to get pictures of all the carparks, but I highly doubt that there would ever be a public dataset for that. Welp.
